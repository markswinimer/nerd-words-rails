Nerd Words is my 2017 application created for my capstone project at Launch Academy. It was created in two weeks by myself.

It is a full stack web application created using React, Ruby on Rails, and Postgres.

Link to the current hosting of the application (hosted on a free Heroku server, will take roughly 30seconds to boot up):
